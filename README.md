1. Adding a task
   - To add a task, the user simply enters the "Add a task" menu by typing "1".
   - The user will then be prompted to add a task of their choosing. After typing out the task, they hit enter.
   - The task will then be added to the list with the status "(Incomplete)" appended to the task.
2. Viewing the tasks list
   - To view the tasks list, the user simply enters the "View tasks" menu by typing "2".
   - This will bring the user to view the list. They will see all of the listed tasks along with their statuses.
   - The user will have an option to type "back" to regress to the main menu.
3. Marking tasks as complete
   - To mark a task as complete, the user simply enters the "Mark a task as complete" menu by typing "3".
   - The user will be provided with the current task list (a message will appear for an empty list) along with the required prompt that asks for a number.
     The user's choice of number will indicate the task on the list that they would like to be marked as "Complete".
   - The program will take that number and print out a new list with the selected task marked "Complete".
4.  Deleting a task
   - To mark a task as complete, the user simply enters the "Delete a task" menu by typing "4".
   - The program will print out the task list and ask the user to enter a number. The number will be the task that the user will like to delete.
   - The program then deletes the task from the list and returns user back to main menu.
5. How to quit running the program
   - To quit the program, the user simply types either "q" or "5".
   - Both inputs have been linked with a break in the program so once the program picks up on that input, the user will be met with a "Goodbye!" messsage and then stop running
     the program.
